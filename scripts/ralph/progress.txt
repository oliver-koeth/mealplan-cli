# Ralph Progress Log
## Codebase Patterns
- Canonical domain enums are defined in `src/mealplan/domain/enums.py`; import enum types from `mealplan.domain.enums` to avoid duplicated value definitions.
- Canonical meal sequencing lives in `src/mealplan/domain/model.py` as `CANONICAL_MEAL_ORDER`; downstream modules should import this constant instead of recreating ordered meal lists.
- Contract DTOs should subclass `BoundaryModel` at every nesting level so `extra="forbid"` applies recursively; use strict numeric types in DTO fields to prevent string-to-number coercion.

Codex output: /Users/Oliver.Koeth/work/mealplan-cli/scripts/ralph/.codex-last-message-iter-7.txt
- Implemented canonical shared meal ordering constant `CANONICAL_MEAL_ORDER` in the domain model module and exported it via `mealplan.domain`.
- Added unit tests validating canonical meal order exact sequence, uniqueness, and fixed six-meal count.
- Files changed: AGENT.md, src/mealplan/domain/model.py, src/mealplan/domain/__init__.py, tests/unit/test_domain_enums.py, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
  - Keep ordering contracts in `mealplan.domain.model` and reuse the tuple in response assembly/allocators to preserve deterministic output ordering.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
  - `US-002` required both package export and explicit test assertions (order + uniqueness + count), not only constant declaration.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
  - `make quality` remains the mandatory local gate (`ruff`, strict `mypy`, and `pytest`) before updating PRD status.

## 2026-02-27 16:46:07 CET - US-001
Codex output: /Users/Oliver.Koeth/work/mealplan-cli/scripts/ralph/.codex-last-message-iter-1.txt
- Implemented canonical `StrEnum` types for `Gender`, `ActivityLevel`, `CarbMode`, `TrainingLoadTomorrow`, and `MealName` in a single domain module and re-exported them from `mealplan.domain`.
- Added contract tests to verify exact enum values, successful parsing of valid payloads, and rejection of unknown enum values.
- Files changed: src/mealplan/domain/enums.py, src/mealplan/domain/__init__.py, tests/unit/test_domain_enums.py, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
  - Canonical value-set contracts should be enforced through Pydantic parsing tests, not only enum member assertions.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
  - The repository has `AGENT.md` (singular) at root rather than `AGENTS.md`; read it as the local agent instruction source.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
  - `make quality` is the required local gate and runs `ruff`, strict `mypy`, and `pytest`.

## 2026-02-27 16:49:35 CET - US-003
Codex output: /Users/Oliver.Koeth/work/mealplan-cli/scripts/ralph/.codex-last-message-iter-2.txt
- Implemented canonical request DTOs `MealPlanRequest` and nested `TrainingSession` in `src/mealplan/application/contracts.py` with exact Phase 2 field names and enum-backed dimensions.
- Enforced strict schema boundary behavior: forbidden unknown fields at all levels and strict numeric typing for `age`, `weight_kg`, and `zones_minutes` values.
- Added contract tests for valid parsing, root/nested unknown-field rejection, and numeric-string rejection while preserving existing probe contract coverage.
- Files changed: AGENT.md, src/mealplan/application/contracts.py, tests/unit/test_application_contracts.py, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
  - Keep request contract strictness in the DTO layer itself (`BoundaryModel` + strict field types) instead of adding ad-hoc checks in CLI/application services.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
  - To enforce unknown-field rejection in nested payloads, nested DTOs must inherit `BoundaryModel`; root-level `extra="forbid"` is not enough.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
  - `US-003` intentionally stops at schema-level validation; semantic/business-rule validation belongs to later stories/phases.

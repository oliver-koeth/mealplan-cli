# Ralph Progress Log
## Codebase Patterns
- Canonical domain enums are defined in `src/mealplan/domain/enums.py`; import enum types from `mealplan.domain.enums` to avoid duplicated value definitions.

Codex output: /Users/Oliver.Koeth/work/mealplan-cli/scripts/ralph/.codex-last-message-iter-1.txt
- Implemented canonical `StrEnum` types for `Gender`, `ActivityLevel`, `CarbMode`, `TrainingLoadTomorrow`, and `MealName` in a single domain module and re-exported them from `mealplan.domain`.
- Added contract tests to verify exact enum values, successful parsing of valid payloads, and rejection of unknown enum values.
- Files changed: src/mealplan/domain/enums.py, src/mealplan/domain/__init__.py, tests/unit/test_domain_enums.py, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
  - Canonical value-set contracts should be enforced through Pydantic parsing tests, not only enum member assertions.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
  - The repository has `AGENT.md` (singular) at root rather than `AGENTS.md`; read it as the local agent instruction source.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
  - `make quality` is the required local gate and runs `ruff`, strict `mypy`, and `pytest`.
